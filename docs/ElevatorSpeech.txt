Hi, my name is Asma. I have background in computer science. All of my previous work has been oriented around people and communication. Whether teaching a foreign language or helping a customer, I try to inject my personality and passion into everything that I do.

I am a returning developer ready to put my passion for programming back to work.

Thereâ€™s never been a better time to be an aspiring software developer and to obtain a challenging position where I can further my career.

Few months ago I started taking online classes to refresh my old coding skills. Self-teaching was flexible and convenient but I needed more structure to my learning, a planned program and curriculum to follow.

After learning about Savvy Coders, I knew their program is going to be the perfect balance of flexibility and structure to ensure my success.

The last 7 years I worked within an e-commerce division, so I decided to design an Online Shopping E-Commerce Site for my capstone project. This project allows users to view various available products, register, sign in, place order, check order status, have access to order history and wish list.
